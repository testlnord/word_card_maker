# Word Card Maker
Flash cards from your browser
============================
Using current plugin: it works on wikipedia.org
============================
* deploy the bash script
* preferences can be checked by typing "about:addons" in Firefox browser
* currently, in preferences you can select different colors of border(e.g. "red") -- and the border will change. In future, here the language will be selected
* by double-clicking the word, you will not see the card with the translation and context, as the property is set to invisible. It will contain the word itself, "Translation" - in order to get translation from server later, and the current context in which the word was found. You can make the card visible by right-clicking the Context menu(and choosing "Show Card" option).
* currently, by right-clicking you'll get the context menu(for future making visible the card and getting translation). Unuseful staff: by clicking "picturesque", you'll get redirected to the url with the picture.
* the icon on the bar doesn't have any functionality yet. Here, in the future, the preference menu can be added(it was not discussed yet)
*now the context is shown in form of a sentence(or less, if we are not provided with the sentence)
