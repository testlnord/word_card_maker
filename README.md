# Word Card Maker
Flash cards from your browser
============================
#Using current plugin: it works on wikipedia.org
#1) deploy the bash script
#2) preferences can be checked by typing "about:addons" in Firefox browser
#3) currently, in preferences you can select different colors of border(e.g. "red") -- and the border will change. In future, here the language will be selected
#4) by double-clicking the word, you will see the red box in the top left corner. It will contain the word itself, "Translation" - in order to get translation from server later, and the current context in which the word was found.
#5) currently, by right-clicking you'll get the context menu(for future making visible the card and getting translation). Unuseful staff: by clicking "picturesque", you'll get redirected to the url with the picture, and by clicking "changeColor", you'll change the border color. It is here only to test the options.
#6) the icon on the bar doesn't have any functionality yet. Here, in the future, the preference menu can be added(it was not discussed yet)
